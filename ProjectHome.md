# Introduction #
The system tries to match a given face image to a set of given face images using a number of eigenfaces .It implements the algorithm developed by M.Turk and Pentland.A build.xml is included in the archive.Unzip the archive to a directory and run ant.

A number of targets are given in the build.xml to run the program using different images and different values for the number of eigenfaces to be used in face recognition.

It is extension of javafaces by sajanjoseph(http://code.google.com/p/javafaces/).

## Feature Added by me: ##

=> Face detection.

=> Adding new face for recognition.

=> Improved GUI.


# Required Software: #

To use jface-rec, you will need to download and install the following software:

> An implementation of Java SE 6
> > OpenJDK 6 http://openjdk.java.net/install/ or
> > Sun JDK 6 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/ or
> > IBM JDK 6 http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/ or
> > Java SE 6 for Mac OS X http://developer.apple.com/java/ etc.

> OpenCV 2.2 http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/

Please keep me informed of any updates or fixes you make to the code so that I may integrate them into the next release. Thank you!

And feel free to ask questions on the mailing list if you encounter any problems with the software! I am sure it is far from perfect...
